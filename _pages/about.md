Trevor is currently a post-doctoral research associate in the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology at the University of Georgia. 

Trevor received his B.A. with honors and a double major in Biology and Environmental Science from Whittier College in 2018, and his Ph.D. in Forestry Biology from the Warnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources at the University of Georgia in 2023. Trained as a tree biotechnologist, he has since shifted his focus to generating knowledge on how educational environments can best support the growth of students. With support from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, his research examines the individual, interpersonal, and contextual variables that support or hinder students' career decision-making, well-being, achievement, and persistence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. 

His research applies theory and methods from organizational, social, and educational psychology to STEM education, with the goals of enhancing career development, fostering inclusive excellence, and elevating the well-being of students in STEM fields. His research utilizes a variety of study designs (e.g., longitudinal, experimental, descriptive, measurement development) and both quantitative (e.g., structural equation modeling, multilevel modeling) and qualitative (e.g., interviews, content analysis) methodological approaches.

Dr. Tuma's research has been published in multiple peer-reviewed biology and biology education journals, and has resulted in numerous presentations at the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research (SABER), the American Education Research Association (AERA), and Understanding Interventions (UI) that Broaden Participation in Science Careers Conferences. In addition to scholarly publications, his research has also received attention from outlets such as Inside Higher Ed, The Chronicle of Evidence-Based Mentoring, and Science Magazine. 

Outside of academia, you can find him hiking and backpacking the Appalachian trail, spending time with his dog, eating chocolate, and practicing hot bikram and vinyasa yoga.
